## Email signature

#### A simple and beautiful signature to include in all your email accounts and clients.

> *Your email signature is as important as any other part of your corporate identity. Using a badly designed email signature is akin to writing your details on a scrap of paper and handing it to a client or prospect. It will get the job done, but what will the recipient think of such a blatant act of poor professionalism?*


Here I attached you a simple, clean and a ready to use email signature.
